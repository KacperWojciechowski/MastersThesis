\subsection*{Streszczenie}

	This dissertation aims to analyze and compare machine learning libraries available for C++ for use in biostatistics. The following chapters describe:

    \begin{itemize}
    	\item [$\bullet$] general problems encountered in the process of implementing machine learning solutions;
    	\item [$\bullet$] characteristics of biostatistics datasets used for testing chosen libraries;
    	\item [$\bullet$] control results of the methods selected for libraries comparison purpose;
    	\item [$\bullet$] Shogun, Shark-ML and Dlib libraries with implementations of selected machine learning methods;
    	\item [$\bullet$] summary of featurs offered by each library in respect to each other.
    \end{itemize}
